Yo, Green
Timin' is everything, my G
Timin' is what separates, like, regular people from pedophiles
Haha
Bar

Uh, real niggas back in style again (Church)
How I'm making a lot of noise from a silent pen (Ahh)
Adjusted the rifle scope, had to dial it in
And fuck a humble loss, I'd rather have a violent win
Viola Davis on the violin, who getting away with murder?
I guess the owl did, throw the towel in (Woo)
They ask me if I'm one of the best
Just think Black Thought on Funkmaster Flex, hmm, yes
Fuck reminiscing, living in the past shit
'Cause not everything old is classic
All I know is get dough, battle rap, I'm reachin like a tip toe
Today's current currency is crypto
Hate to blast ya, but I have to
I suggest you get low, ya life's played out like Sprinkle Bae
And them fuckin "For the Dick" posts
Who rocks the coast? Rassy
Cardigans and cashmere, fuck last year

Out with the old, in with the new
Fuck what you did, it's about what it do
F-L-Y, fuck last year
F-L-Y, fuck last year
Out with the old, in with the new
Fuck what you did, it's about what it do
F-L-Y, fuck last year
Life's a bitch then you die, time fly

Every year the ball drop in Times Square
Age twelve my balls dropped, adolescent male
Ball big like LaVar ('Var), spit like Lamar ('Mar)
Not a Arabic, still tryin' to get it, Inshallah (Get what?)
Get to the bag like airport carousels
Industry dudes saying real rap will never sell
You know that guy, the Carrot Top, the fairy tale
That nigga, half snake and rat nigga
Trap nigga, he don't like boom-bap, well that figures
I dispose of these hoes, Jack Ripper
Lot of bitches getting blocked on the 'Gram, she feel tight
I'm not likin' a hundred pics I can't fuck in real life (Bitch)
Green, we go back to 4-tracks
So you entitled to your opinion, but not your own facts
Niggas is so wack, throwin' up on your throwback
Time F-L-Y, now hold that

Out with the old, in with the new
Fuck what you did, it's about what it do
F-L-Y, fuck last year
F-L-Y, fuck last year
Out with the old, in with the new
Fuck what you did, it's about what it do
F-L-Y, fuck last year
Life's a bitch then you die, time fly

We gonna— we gon' rob y'all at the end of the night (Yay)
We gonna take everything (Yeah)
And, uh, straight like that
This what it's all about
Celebration is all about love, love, love
Let's go (Yeah)
Shout out to Ras Kass
