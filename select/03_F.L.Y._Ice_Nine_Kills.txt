I won't deny
The way time flies
When we're close to the end
Now, I'm thinking
I spent my life
Learning to fly
Despite a constant descent
I was born to fly
They say moral mistakes might mutate
Despite these gifted hands
I'm not saying I'm not playing God
I'm not saying I'm not playing God
So I'm raising the stakes, activate
Soon, they'll understand
I'm not saying I'm not playing God
While they're praying, I'm just saying
I won't deny
The way time flies
When we're so close to the end
And now, I'm thinking
I spent my life
Learning to fly
Against a constant descent
And now, I'm thinking
Cracking the code simply bolsters
The bounds of the brain
I'm not saying I'm not playing God
I'm not saying I'm not playing God
But this foul insect, undetected
Just fused with my frame
I'm not saying I'm not playing God
I'm not saying I'm worth saving
I won't deny
The way time flies
When we're so close to the end
And now, I'm thinking
I spent my life
Learning to fly
Against a constant descent
And now, I'm thinking
Faster and faster
I circle disaster now
And I can't stop this fluttering free fall
Headed for Hell's walls now
Now
And now, I'm thinking
I won't deny
The way time flies
When we're so close to the end
And now, I'm thinking
I spent my life
Learning to fly
Against a constant descent
And now, I'm thinking
And now, I'm thinking
I was born to fly
